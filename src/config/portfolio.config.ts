      category: ["hybrid-cloud", "ai-ml", "mobile", "healthcare"],

      description:
        "Problem: Healthcare platforms are expensive, non-compliant, and vendor-locked to a single cloud. Solution: A production-grade, tri-cloud telehealth ecosystem (AWS + GCP + Azure) with 7 microservices (5 Node.js + 2 Python FastAPI), Kafka event streaming, AI Circuit Breaker (Bedrock/Vertex/Azure OpenAI), 13-step RAG pipeline with PII scrubbing, 414 Terraform resources, 42 FHIR R4 resource types with 10 medical terminology systems, and 756+ test assertions across 39+ test files — all at $2/mo idle cost (99.3% reduction from $300/mo). 44,500+ lines of code.",

      fullDescription: `MediConnect is a production-grade, multi-cloud healthcare platform that evolved through 3 major versions — from a serverless prototype (V1) to a fully compliant tri-cloud ecosystem (V3) across AWS, GCP, and Azure. 7 backend microservices (5 Node.js/Express, 2 Python/FastAPI), 4 Lambda functions across 2 AWS regions, 44,500+ lines of code.

INFRASTRUCTURE & COST
Zero-Cost Idle Architecture: $300+/month reduced to $2/month (99.3% reduction) across 3 clouds with 414 Terraform resources — verified by Prowler on HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2, ISO 27001. Active-active Kubernetes clusters on AKS (Azure) + EKS (AWS), hidden behind Cloudflare Tunnels with zero exposed ports. Auto-failover to GCP Cloud Run within 5 seconds.

COMPLIANCE (Architecturally Enforced)
HIPAA 2026: KMS envelope encryption, immutable FHIR AuditEvent logs, breach detection, 15-min auto-logout, KMS-signed prescriptions, DICOM de-identification. GDPR/Schrems II: EU data locked to Frankfurt, consent ledger, cascading erasure. SOC 2 Type II: 13 CloudWatch metrics, idempotency guard, PITR 35-day recovery. 96 Checkov IaC security fixes, GuardDuty + Macie + CloudTrail.

FHIR R4 & CLINICAL
42 FHIR R4 resource types with 10 medical terminology systems (RxNorm, SNOMED CT, ICD-10-CM, ICD-11, LOINC, CVX, MVX, NDC, CPT, HCPCS). SMART on FHIR STU 2.0, full DICOMweb REST API (PS3.18), C-CDA 2.1 document generation, ONC-compliant interoperability. Clinical modules: CDS Hooks, med-reconciliation, prior-auth, MPI, bulk export, emergency access.

AI & REAL-TIME
99.99% AI availability via Circuit Breaker across Bedrock (Claude) / Vertex (Gemini) / Azure (GPT-4) — 13-step RAG pipeline with PII scrubbing, confidence scoring, and hallucination detection. Model Router with dynamic model selection per task type. AI Scribe: Transcribe Medical → SOAP Notes → EHR. Sub-second IoT vitals via Socket.io + MQTT. Kafka event streaming (MSK Serverless + Docker, 7 topics).

TESTING & PAYMENTS
756+ test assertions across 39+ test files (483 backend TS compliance + 53 RAG pipeline + 50 RAG red team + 15 RAG evaluation + 129 Python + 66 frontend Vitest + 10 Playwright E2E + 4 IaC verification scripts). 3-tier Stripe subscriptions with 24-loophole protection.`,

      fullDescription: `Chronos is a production-ready headless e-commerce platform for luxury watches using a decoupled architecture where a React SPA communicates with WordPress 7.0 backend via GraphQL and REST APIs.

FRONTEND
React 18 SPA with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and 48 shadcn/ui components on Radix UI primitives. 14 routes (9 lazy-loaded for code splitting), TanStack React Query for server state management, real Stripe Checkout redirect, JWT authentication, Framer Motion page transitions, and react-helmet-async for SEO meta tags.

BACKEND
WordPress 7.0 with WooCommerce, custom OOP PHP 8.1+ plugin "chronos-bridge" (27 classes, 4,613 LOC, PSR-4 autoloading). Custom Gutenberg blocks (watch showcase, collection grid, contact form). Custom Post Type (chronos_watch) with custom taxonomies (chronos_brand, chronos_movement). TransientCache with Redis-ready object cache.

AI & PAYMENTS
WordPress 7.0 AI Client for auto-generated watch descriptions and smart contact auto-responder. Real Stripe Checkout Sessions with webhook handling and signature verification, custom checkout fields.

TESTING & CI/CD
52 tests (33 PHPUnit + 19 Jest), 0 PHPCS errors. GitHub Actions CI/CD with 4 jobs: PHP Tests, Blocks Build & Tests, Frontend Build, and a manual production deploy gated behind dry-run validation and an explicit enable flag (no automatic infrastructure activity). Dependabot weekly scanning.

HOSTING — $0/MONTH, ALWAYS ON
Static React frontend on Cloudflare Pages; WordPress/WooCommerce backend on a GCP always-free e2-micro VM behind nginx with a free hostname and Let's Encrypt TLS. Migrated off an expiring custom domain: nginx server_name change, fresh certificate, WP_HOME/WP_SITEURL constants, and 108 database URL replacements — verified live with GraphQL returning products and correct CORS for the Pages origin, and zero old-domain references in the deployed bundle.

COMPLIANCE

      description:
        "Status first: implemented and locally verified as of 15 July 2026, but production is not proven — live deployment, live source pulls for three of the four connectors, and the production WordPress flow are all blocked on client-controlled access. Problem: a creator's material sat in five disconnected silos (two YouTube channels, a membership platform, a course platform, a cloud drive, and selected reference sites), so members had no way to query any of it and answering one question meant hunting through hours of video. Solution: a members-only chat front door on WordPress backed by a single FastAPI process and one portable SQLite file — hybrid dense + keyword retrieval fused by Reciprocal Rank Fusion, a measured relevance floor that returns a configured refusal instead of inventing an answer, and no-fabrication rules locked in code beneath an editable persona. No vector database, no paid plugin, no monthly SaaS.",

      fullDescription: `A members-only knowledge assistant for a WordPress membership site. A member asks a plain question in an embedded chat interface and gets an answer drawn from the creator's own material, with source citations, instead of a generic chatbot answer or an open-internet result.

HONEST STATUS — READ THIS FIRST
As of the 15 July 2026 verification run, the local package is complete and verified; the deployed system is not, and is not represented as such. Not claimed as passed: live server inventory and deployment (the provided cloud login cannot enumerate instances and no usable address, login user or installed key was supplied), live Drive/membership/course/restricted-web pulls (machine access, exports, folder identifiers and approved lists were not supplied), the production WordPress logged-out/logged-in HTTPS flow, PHP syntax validation of the plugin (no PHP interpreter in the verification environment), and an independent fresh-context review of the final diff. A development credential exposed during container configuration validation requires rotation before any further provider use.

THE CONSTRAINTS THAT SHAPED EVERYTHING
Three client constraints drove every architecture decision: no recurring subscription costs (no paid plugins, no hosted vector database, no flat monthly SaaS — only a small server and pay-as-you-go model usage on the client's own account), answers must stay grounded in the creator's own content with internet search restricted rather than open, and members-only access at go-live. Two infrastructure facts changed the plan mid-build: the WordPress site runs on shared managed hosting that serves PHP only, so the engine could never live where the site lives; and the deployment target became an existing cloud instance already running six unrelated agents that must not be disturbed, which turned deployment from a routine install into an isolation problem.

GROUNDING IS NOT LEFT TO THE PROMPT
A relevance gate runs on the retrieved passages before generation. When nothing clears the threshold, the assistant returns a configured refusal — produced without a model call at all — instead of an invented answer. The rules forbidding fabrication live in code and cannot be removed by editing the assistant's configurable personality. Every grounded reply carries deduplicated source citations.

HYBRID RETRIEVAL WITHOUT A VECTOR DATABASE
Dense semantic similarity is computed in NumPy over embeddings stored in a single SQLite file; keyword matching uses SQLite FTS5 over the same rows; the two rankings are combined with Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Pure vector search reliably misses exact terms such as a program name or a job title, and the keyword arm recovers them. Embeddings are pluggable: a local CPU sentence-transformer model (384-dim) is the zero-cost production default, and a hosted API (768-dim) is the torch-free alternative, selected by configuration.

ATOMIC SOURCE SYNCHRONIZATION
Four connectors feed the knowledge base: public YouTube transcripts, Google Drive via a read-only service account, a membership platform, and a course platform. YouTube ingestion is additive by stable video URL. The other three synchronize a complete snapshot atomically — discovery, extraction and embedding all complete before a single database transaction — so a re-index adds new documents, replaces edited documents, removes deleted documents, and leaves the last good database intact when a connector fails.

MEMBERS-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION
The WordPress plugin renders nothing for logged-out visitors and mints a short-lived HMAC-signed token; the long-lived signing secret never reaches browser JavaScript. Ingestion runs under a separate secret. Rate limiting is per resolved client identity and returns HTTP 429. The engine refuses to start when production configuration is unsafe.

RESTRICTED INTERNET SEARCH THAT FAILS CLOSED
A separate query-time web source exists but is never ingested, and it cannot run unless the operator has supplied both an approved keyword allowlist and an approved list of HTTPS sites. Both fallback and equal-source modes preserve honest provenance and label web-sourced results.

ISOLATED DEPLOYMENT
Because six unrelated agents already run on the target instance, every deployment artifact is additive: a dedicated user, directory, virtual environment, localhost port, new systemd service and timer units, and a new nginx server block on its own hostname. No existing agent is edited or restarted.

VERIFIED EVIDENCE (15 JULY 2026 LOCAL RUN)
Eleven offline integration and behavior scripts covering connector parsing, hybrid retrieval, atomic synchronization, recursive Drive discovery, membership and course API contracts, production configuration, backup and retention, signed HTTP authentication, ingestion-secret separation, rate limiting, source filters, restricted-web provenance, deployment rendering, release and configuration auditing, and legacy database migration. Ruff, MyPy, Bandit (zero findings, zero suppressions), Semgrep Python/OWASP, dependency consistency and JavaScript syntax all pass. A fresh container image build and quiet compose validation succeeded, and a temporary isolated container returned success from both health routes. The release archive passed integrity, forbidden-path audit and an independent Gitleaks scan. Packaged knowledge base: 228 chunks from 10 distinct video URLs. These describe one dated verification run of the local package, not a production proof.`,

Solution: Full ADA/WCAG 2.1 AA remediation via 6 server-side PHP code snippets (zero theme modifications), GDPR cookie consent with CookieYes (25 cookies categorized), and custom PHP output buffer that strips 4 hardcoded tracking scripts (Meta Pixel, AdRoll, Google Ads, Bing UET) before consent and reloads after — verified 0 tracking requests before consent across 16 pages.",

      fullDescription: `Groza Learning Center is a real client project (Upwork contract, April 2026) — full ADA accessibility remediation and GDPR compliance implementation for a WordPress/Elementor education website in Los Angeles.

PHASE 1: ADA / WCAG 2.1 AA COMPLIANCE
Full WAVE + Lighthouse audit across 30+ pages. Fixed 100+ accessibility errors: 50+ missing alt texts (WP_HTML_Tag_Processor), broken ARIA references on mega-menus, empty buttons/links (search, nav, social icons), missing form labels (reCAPTCHA, CF7), broken skip navigation, heading hierarchy issues. Resolved 200+ color contrast failures with 15 distinct color corrections (all meeting 4.5:1 AA minimum). Disabled UserWay overlay widget (active class action lawsuit Feb 2026, 1,023 companies sued while using overlays). All fixes via server-side PHP Code Snippets — zero theme or plugin files modified, fully reversible.

PHASE 2: TRACKING & PRIVACY CLEANUP
Removed dead Universal Analytics (loading for ~2 years to shut-down endpoint). Restricted reCAPTCHA v3 to form pages only (was loading on all 30+ pages). Switched YouTube embeds to privacy-enhanced mode (youtube-nocookie.com), future-proof for any new videos.

PHASE 3: GDPR COOKIE CONSENT
Installed CookieYes consent banner (GDPR worldwide). Scanned and categorized 25 cookies across 4 categories (Necessary, Analytics, Advertisement, Functional). Manually fixed 3 cookies auto-scan missed. Enabled Google Consent Mode and Microsoft UET Consent Mode.

PHASE 4: GDPR SCRIPT BLOCKING
Discovered 4 tracking scripts hardcoded directly in HTML (not managed by any WordPress plugin). Built custom PHP output buffer solution: strips scripts from HTML at server level using preg_replace, stores in JS function in footer, reads cookieyes-consent cookie, loads scripts only after "advertisement" consent, listens for real-time consent changes. Verified: 0 Facebook requests before consent, full tracking after Accept, across 16 pages.

KEY PHP TECHNIQUES
WP_HTML_Tag_Processor for alt text injection, style_loader_tag filter for contrast CSS overrides, str_ireplace for site-wide text replacements, ob_start output buffer for GDPR script masking, preg_replace for tracking script removal, wp_dequeue_script for conditional reCAPTCHA loading.`,

      fullDescription: `HealthCode Analysis is a full-stack WordPress automation platform that clones Elementor-based template websites and programmatically replaces all content — photos, text, headings, and SEO metadata — for multiple customers via a single command.

AUTOMATION ENGINE
WordPress REST API Bridge Plugin (healthcode-api-bridge.php) with timing-safe API key authentication. Elementor JSON Parser recursively walks nested JSON trees to find and replace images, headings, text editors, and repeater fields. One-Command Customer Deployment reads a customer JSON config and executes the full pipeline: upload photos, swap Elementor JSON, update Rank Math SEO metadata, upload logo/favicon, and flush caches. Dry-run mode previews every change without touching the live site.

NEUROSCAN v5.0
Custom PHP framework with modular grid system, intelligent metadata calculation (server-side read time), and multi-instance architecture with scoped JavaScript for zero-conflict grids. Zero-reload AJAX filtering, live contextual search, and smart routing protection.

AI & CLOUD
AskMe AI chatbot on Cloudflare Workers with Dialogflow ES — $0/month, scales to unlimited posts. Publishing bundles a generated public content index directly into the Worker, so the chatbot answers from real site content without needing WordPress at request time. AI content augmentation with auto-generated summaries and medical prompt engineering.

DOMAIN-INDEPENDENT PUBLISHING
Local WordPress is the authoring source; a deterministic static exporter publishes the site to Cloudflare Pages and the chatbot reaches its Worker through a same-origin proxy. Verified in production: with WordPress, Docker, the tunnel, and the custom domain all offline, the Pages frontend and chatbot still return HTTP 200 with real content. Bundle validation fails the build if any localhost, private-IP, tunnel, or expired-domain reference leaks into HTML, CSS, JS, or JSON.

ZERO-COST LIVE DEMO
A 24/7 live WordPress admin/Elementor demo runs co-hosted on an existing always-free GCP e2-micro — isolated memory-capped PHP-FPM pool, dedicated database, its own nginx server block and Let's Encrypt cert — at $0, with an nginx FastCGI micro-cache serving cached pages in ~8ms on a 0.25 vCPU machine.

DESIGN & TESTING
Dark Glassmorphism Design System (vanilla JS, zero dependencies). 292 automated tests — 281 core (unit + integration + end-to-end swap verification, ~59% coverage with enforcement threshold) + 11 static-exporter tests. 2 CI/CD pipelines with Ruff linter, Bandit security scan, pre-commit hooks, and Dependabot.`,

      fullDescription: `EmailFinder is a Python CLI tool that discovers and verifies business emails using only HTTP requests — no SMTP, no paid API keys, no rate limits.

PIPELINE
5-step waterfall: DNS/MX validation with provider detection (Google/Microsoft/Zoho), web scraping across 15+ pages per domain (HTML, mailto links, obfuscated patterns), pattern generation (8 common email formats), multi-signal verification (Gravatar avatar lookup, GitHub commit search, disposable domain detection), and weighted confidence scoring (0-99%).

DNS INTELLIGENCE
MX record resolution, SPF record parsing, DMARC policy detection, email provider identification (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Zoho, ProtonMail, Fastmail, self-hosted).

WEB SCRAPING
Crawls homepage, about, team, contact, staff, people pages with both www and non-www variants. Extracts standard emails, mailto links, and obfuscated patterns (name [at] domain [dot] com). Filters junk domains and non-email patterns.

VERIFICATION
Gravatar check (MD5 hash → avatar lookup), GitHub user search (public commit email), disposable domain detection (100+ providers), RFC 5322 syntax validation. All HTTP-based — works behind ISP port 25 blocks.

SCORING
Weighted confidence engine: scraped + name match + Gravatar = 99%. Pattern + Gravatar = 65-75%. Pattern only = 45-50%. Disposable domain = 0%.`,

Static-verified delivery contract: 8 commits, +1,484 / -175 lines across 18 files, all locally committed and pending client funding.

PIPELINE REBUILD
Native Pinecone retriever (replaced LangChain wrapper) with hoisted lazy singletons for Pinecone client, embedder, and index handle. Score threshold 0.7 enforced. GPT-4o-mini query rewriting (max 80 tokens, temp 0.2) before retrieval. Hybrid dense top-20 + BM25 top-20 merge with deduplication, then Cohere rerank-english-v3.0 to top-5. Cohere failure or missing API key falls back to dense-only top-5 with 0.7 threshold.

KNOWLEDGE INGESTION
PCOS corpus ingestion script with recursive splitter (size 1000, overlap 200), per-chunk metadata (source_id, title, section, last_reviewed_date, reviewer_initials, jurisdiction), SHA-256 idempotent upserts, Pinecone describeIndex dimension safety check before any work. Static-only ship per "engineer ships code, clinician ships content" decision.

SAFETY GATES (CODE-ENFORCED)
Structured outputs json_schema with {reply, confidence, citations[], emergency_flag}. Empty citations OR confidence < 0.6 triggers safe fallback. Cosine grounding gate at threshold 0.55, skipped only when confidence ≥ 0.9. Emergency detector with 47 patterns (cardiac, respiratory, neurological, stroke FAST, bleeding, anaphylaxis, mental-health crisis) fires BEFORE any LLM round-trip — 17/17 true positives, 15/15 false-positive guards.

LATENCY WINS
Promise.allSettled for parallel weather + geocode (soft geocode failure no longer poisons weather). Redis-backed embedding cache (SHA-256 of normalized rewritten query, 1h TTL) and response cache (SHA-256 of query + age + category, 1h TTL) via utils/cache.js. Cache key normalization (lowercase, collapse whitespace, strip trailing punctuation). Lazy Redis client + isReady gate ensures Redis-down does not break the request path.

CONTEXT LEAKAGE FIXES
XML-tagged userCtx (<user_query>, <user_profile>, <rag_context>, <conversation_history>). Both system prompts reference all four tag names verbatim. Topic-aware history filter via cosine similarity threshold 0.5, cap 6, preserve chronological order. embedTurn caches per-turn embeddings via the same Redis embedding cache.

VERIFICATION (M1)
node --check clean on 17 files. /security-review NO_FINDINGS at confidence ≥8 — NoSQL/Mongoose injection, SSRF, path traversal, hardcoded secrets, weak crypto, JWT bypass, response cache cross-user leakage, embedding cache poisoning, error/stack-trace exposure all checked. cosineSimilarity, sha256Hex, normalizeKey, detectEmergency all unit-tested.

MILESTONE 2 — MULTI-CONDITION + MULTILINGUAL EXPANSION (9 tasks, 302 tests all pass)
BGE-M3 multilingual embedding (BAAI/bge-m3 via @xenova/transformers, 1024-dim) — supports Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and 100+ languages. Pinecone index recreated at 1024 dims, all 6 conditions re-ingested (346 chunks total across 6 namespaces). Self-hosted cross-encoder: Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 loads once at server boot, eliminates Cohere per-request cost, warmup at startup. 6 condition namespaces: pcos-knowledge, diabetes-knowledge, masld-knowledge, obesity-knowledge, mental-wellness-knowledge, home-remedies-knowledge. conditionRouter.js classifies queries into conditions — supports cross-condition queries (e.g., "PCOS with insulin resistance" → [pcos, diabetes]). Mental wellness crisis detection: detectMentalCrisis with Hindi transliterations (marna chahta hoon, jina nahi chahta, khud ko hurt karna) + iCall/Vandrevala Foundation escalation. Per-user health profile: {conditions, symptoms, labValues, medications} persisted to user-{id} Pinecone namespace and injected into every response. Evaluation framework: 220 reference queries + 30 Hindi transliteration queries — routing 97.2%, safety 100%, fallback 100%. Branch: milestone-2, final commit: ea5bf7c.

MILESTONE 3 — WHATSAPP CHANNEL + STREAMING (LIVE, July 2026)
Interakt WhatsApp Business webhook with HMAC signature verification (valid → 200, tampered or missing → 401), SSE token streaming via /ask/stream, Redis-backed caching live in production, product suggestions, and human handoff. Orchestration gating: the client's no-code Interakt flow owns greetings and menus, so the AI stays silent on greetings and button taps and answers only conversations routed to it via a per-user Health-Query lane marker (stored in chat history — no schema change). A "free-answer limit reached" CTA fires exactly once per user via a persisted marker turn instead of re-firing on every message. Deploy discipline on every release: drift-check live vs local first, full server backup, SHA-256 parity between deployed and committed files, and flat process restart counts (no crash loops) — verified with a stubbed end-to-end harness run on the live server with zero real WhatsApp sends.`,

      fullDescription: `RegenAI is a 105-day portfolio build of a clinician-reviewed wellness commerce platform on Shopify Plus + Hydrogen — scoped as commerce + content + data + regulatory across four engineering layers. Day 19 of 105 delivered as of April 2026.

LAYER 1 — STOREFRONT
Hydrogen 2026.4 on React Router v7, deployed to Cloudflare Workers (pivoted from Shopify Oxygen at Day 10 / ADR-011 after Shopify confirmed Hydrogen channel is not available on dev stores). Tailwind v4 @theme block drives the token system. Radix primitives wrapped in @regenai/ui design-system package (15 primitives + Storybook). Sentry client + web-vitals integration ships as first-class concern.

LAYER 2 — CUSTOM MERCHANT APP
Remix application on Cloudflare Worker + D1, OAuth install flow 302-redirects to real Shopify authorize URL with correct scopes + state + redirect (tested end-to-end). Polaris-rendered clinician-review queue UI. Hand-rolled Shopify OAuth + HMAC helpers (no library dependency).

LAYER 3 — SHOPIFY FUNCTIONS (RUST → WASM)
4 functions written in Rust, compiled to WASM, all under 200 KB (Shopify cap is 1.5 MB per extension). 47 pure-rules-core cargo tests pass.
- cart-contraindication — blocks checkout when customer's medical-flag metafield conflicts with product's contraindication tag
- b2b-tiered-pricing — wholesale tier pricing logic
- delivery-customization — market-aware delivery routing
- discount-stacking — combinable discount rules

LAYER 4 — REGULATORY POSTURE
FDA claim linting (regex-based, runs in CI on every PDP copy change). DSHEA supplement validator (flags unsubstantiated structure/function claims). Contraindication presence check (any PDP for a Class II device fails compliance-lint workflow if it lacks a ContraindicationCallout block). Age-gated checkout via Shopify Function. WCAG 2.2 AA as default — skip link, semantic main landmark, focus-visible rings, nonce-respecting inline scripts, ARIA role-descriptions on gallery + body-area carousel.

CATALOG
150+ SKUs across 7 categories (recovery devices, sleep systems, mental recovery, biomarker diagnostics, supplements, home gym, women's health). All modeled as real commerce objects with variants, metaobjects, and compliance-critical metafields.

MARKETS & LOCALES
5 markets — US, CA, UK, EU, AU — with FDA vs CE-marked SKU segmentation, market-aware storefront routing, checkout profiles, per-market inventory routing, and tax profiles.
5 locales — English, Spanish, French, German, Arabic — with full right-to-left layout flipping for Arabic.

CI / QUALITY
10 CI workflows run honest-green (no masked failures): 7 truly pass, 2 intentionally warn-only with documented Day-16 and Day-36 resolution dates, 1 clean-skip until Percy specs land. 17 Architecture Decision Records on file. $0 spent on infrastructure (one paid item, $5 OpenAI credit, deferred to Day 31).`,

Theme Blocks architecture throughout (Horizon-style, 8-level nesting). Every storefront surface block-composable by the merchant. Vanilla JavaScript with Web Components — zero runtime dependency on any front-end framework, theme ships unbundled. Modern design-token CSS with full brand system (cream, olive, saffron, terracotta, espresso). Serif-heading + sans-body pair with Arabic fallback stack (Aref Ruqaa and IBM Plex Sans Arabic under [dir="rtl"]). Spacing, motion, radii, shadows all tokenized. Metaobjects first for editorial content (Farm, Farmer, Region, Certification, Recipe). Full WCAG 2.1 AA — deeper olive tokens (5.76 contrast on cream), axe-core scanned on every PR. English and Arabic locales shipped with hreflang tags and CLDR-correct Arabic plural forms.

OBSERVABILITY
Sentry frontend error tracking (CDN Loader pattern, PII scrubbing in beforeSend hook). Web Vitals library reporting Core Web Vitals as custom events to GA4. localStorage-based feature-flag system with URL override, Do-Not-Track compliance, and exposure analytics events.

CI / QUALITY GATES (every PR)
Liquid lint via Shopify theme-check — 181 tracked files, zero offenses. Shopify Lighthouse CI with Performance 0.90 and Accessibility 0.95 thresholds. Accessibility scan via axe-core through Playwright across home, cart, collection, search routes. Playwright golden-path E2E tests for PDP, cart, quiz, search, navigation. Percy visual regression with 6 snapshots across 4 viewport widths. Secret scanning via gitleaks on every PR, every push, plus weekly scheduled deep scan. Dependabot weekly updates grouped by vendor. Deploy workflows for dev, staging, production — production gated by required-reviewer rule.

      fullDescription: `Fine Touch Marketing (FTM) is an ongoing paid client engagement — a med-spa marketing agency operating 15-20 WordPress client sites. This is the SEO system of three separate production systems built for them.

WHAT IT DOES
An authorized operator supplies a WordPress site, selects pages or posts, and submits one or more existing titles with optional location context. The system discovers the matching content over the WordPress REST API, validates that AIOSEO is available, generates a structured SEO draft, validates and repairs that draft against deterministic rules, persists it through AIOSEO, assigns relevant WordPress tags where supported, and returns a per-item result summary as CSV and in the interface.

CURRENT RUNTIME — PHP INTERFACE + SUPERVISED PYTHON API
The live path is a protected PHP web interface proxying same-origin authenticated operator actions to a local Python Flask API. The API creates a job, returns a job identifier immediately, runs the work in the background, and exposes safe status summaries the browser polls. This removes the original constraint where a long SEO run depended on a single browser request remaining open. The project also retains a substantial n8n workflow history — that earlier automation path established the title matching, structured generation, AIOSEO updates, tag creation and result aggregation that the current runtime inherited. The n8n lineage is history, not the current live runtime.

GENERATION CONTRACT AND DETERMINISTIC REPAIR
The AI output path constrains industry, location, title length, description length, focus keyword shape and keyword count. Claude produces the draft inside those supplied constraints; deterministic repair rules then fix what the model got wrong rather than trusting the output as-is. Location is derived per page rather than hardcoded, so one run can cover pages for different cities.

JULY 2026 ADDITIONS — PLANNING AND ARTICLE GENERATION
An independent heatmap analyzer, a geo relevance planner, plan-by-address without a heatmap, and full-article generation for both pages and posts with factual controls on the generated content.

OPERATIONAL POSTURE
Public interface health and backend API health are checked separately — a page that loads does not prove the worker API is alive — and a health-based watchdog restarts the API when the service is genuinely unavailable. Local and deployed sources were compared during the latest recovery evidence. The system is presented as an automation accelerator with operational controls, not as a ranking guarantee: it makes no promise about rankings, traffic or indexing time, and client review of location accuracy, branding and regulated wording is still required.`,

      fullDescription: `Fine Touch Marketing (FTM) is an ongoing paid client engagement — a med-spa marketing agency operating 15-20 WordPress client sites. This is the SMS follow-up system of three separate production systems built for them.

WHAT IT DOES
A customer submits a web form. The system resolves which client site the submission belongs to, records the contact inside that site's own data area, sends the configured welcome message from that site's configured sender, and later evaluates that contact against explicit due dates for scheduled follow-ups. A separate broadcast lane lets an authorized operator send or schedule approved campaign messages through the same site-aware configuration model.

THREE SEPARATE LANES, ON PURPOSE
Immediate submission handling, scheduled follow-up evaluation, and broadcast processing are kept apart. That separation makes a failure easy to isolate, lets each lane be tested on its own, and stops a marketing operation from interfering with form capture.

CONFIGURATION OWNS CLIENT BEHAVIOR
The platform serves many client websites without duplicating the workflow set per site. Routing, sender selection, message-template selection, reply information, activation state and follow-up timing are all driven by controlled sheet data. The automation code owns reusable behavior; client-specific wording and routing data stay configuration. Templates resolve site-specific first with a global fallback, and inbound reply guidance is assembled from per-site configuration rather than hardcoded client details.

VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS
A registered form route is authoritative — an untrusted hidden field in the submission cannot redirect a lead into another client's messaging path. Active sites are evaluated from configuration rather than a hardcoded list in control code. A valid first submission can provision the canonical contact structure without a workflow edit. One broken or missing site data area is isolated so it cannot abort follow-up processing for every other site. Day-one sent state is written only after the messaging provider reports a successful send. Deployment checks compare editable workflow state against the active published state before completion is claimed.

EXPLICIT NON-GOALS
No credentials or secret material in business-facing documentation. No uncontrolled messaging to an unverified form, an inactive site, or an ambiguous destination. No client-specific message text embedded in reusable workflow code. No assumption that a provider accepted a message merely because a workflow step started.

HONEST STATUS
Presented as controlled and production-oriented, not infallible. Historical evidence includes a complete 29-case end-to-end suite from the earlier release cycle, later production incident reproductions, controlled repair tests, and a live missing-site fault-injection check. Those results demonstrate specific behaviors at their recorded dates. Ongoing value depends on disciplined site onboarding, approved message content, provider health, consent controls, active monitoring, and verification after every workflow or configuration change.`,

        "Problem: The agency needed repeatable social content for many small-business clients without designing every image and writing every caption by hand — and the real risk was not generation, it was whether clients would actually review, request changes and approve. Solution: A team member onboards a business, the system researches the brand from its website and social profiles, AI generates scheduled post concepts with captions, hashtags and images, the client reviews watermarked assets through a tokenized portal, and the agency gives final internal approval before clean assets are packaged for download. Two approval layers mean nothing reaches a client's channels unreviewed. Latest recorded evidence: 21/21 live end-to-end checks passed.",

      fullDescription: `Fine Touch Marketing (FTM) is an ongoing paid client engagement — a med-spa marketing agency. This is the social content system of three separate production systems built for them. Stage: live-maintenance trial platform.

THE ACTUAL PRODUCT RISK
The trial architecture deliberately validates the workflow and the commercial process before committing to a full multi-tenant SaaS rewrite. The main product risk was never whether content could be generated — it was whether clients reliably review, request changes and approve through a portal. The system is built to answer that question.

FLOW
A team member onboards a business. The system researches that brand from its website and social profiles. AI generates scheduled post concepts with captions, hashtags and images. Watermarked review assets go to a tokenized client portal where the client can approve, request changes, request repeated image changes, or edit caption and hashtag text directly. After client approval the agency sees an internal awaiting-approval queue and gives or withholds final approval. Only then are clean, unwatermarked assets packaged as a ZIP for download.

ROLES AND BOUNDARIES
Three roles: administrator, team member, end client. Team visibility is isolated — a team member sees their own clients. Clean assets are protected until internal approval; review assets are watermarked. The verified product boundary ends at generation, review, internal approval and clean-asset packaging: approved assets are downloaded for manual scheduling. Direct publishing to a social network is explicitly not the current verified path, and neither is a production-grade multi-tenant identity platform, guaranteed scraping coverage, or a transactional database.

ARCHITECTURE
Static browser applications (admin/team dashboard plus tokenized client portal) call a public proxy boundary that forwards approved routes to an n8n workflow suite. n8n owns orchestration and state transitions against Google Sheets state — clients, posts, users, settings and notification/log tabs. Server-side utilities handle image generation and editing, brand research, watermarking, clean-asset access and archive creation.

An 18-phase full workflow trial covering admin login, team creation and login, client creation by both admin and team, brand scraping, content generation with images/captions/hashtags, approval-link creation, portal viewing, client approve/reject/regenerate/edit, admin awaiting counts and final decision, clean ZIP generation, team visibility isolation, and exact test-data cleanup. A reliability suite recorded 17/17 passing after repairs for sheet quota pressure, notification propagation, regeneration version handling, duplicate response data and image-generation timing. The current feature suite recorded 21/21 live checks passing after adding clean download behavior, portal presentation, multi-post-per-day scheduling, client and admin bulk approval, direct caption/hashtag editing, repeated image-change requests, live admin status filters, administrator AI edit and image upload, and social-profile brand enrichment.

HONEST STATUS
These are dated verification records, not permanent guarantees — the relevant suite is re-run after workflow, frontend, provider or schema changes. Local workflow snapshots are not assumed to be the active production revision: workflow exports, deployment payloads and live state can diverge, so active workflow identity and source parity are confirmed before changing behavior.`,

Private local coding is separated from internet research, credentials are used as capabilities without their values entering model context, and the strictest applicable policy always wins.",

      fullDescription: `A fail-closed local control plane for software work performed with Codex, Claude Code, VS Code, terminal workflows, local Ollama models, and separately approved provider-backed workers. It replaces the idea of one unrestricted coding agent with a deterministic broker that owns scope, policy, task state, isolation, artifacts, verification evidence and release decisions.

HONEST STATUS — READ THIS FIRST
As of 30 July 2026, Phase 1 is incomplete and validation remains synthetic only. The most recent integrated authority-foundation source passed its scoped synthetic gates before integration; the latest Phase 1 closure task was cancelled before complete quality, independent review, integration, release, deployment or push. Live client onboarding, real provider transmission, real credentials, regulated data, staging, production and deployment remain prohibited until later evidence and exact per-project authorization exist. Historical results establish only the tested synthetic state of their reviewed revision — they do not establish Phase 1 closure, authorize a real provider, prove every operating system configuration, or replace per-client production acceptance.

THE CENTRAL SECURITY RULE — SEPARATION OF AUTHORITY
Models may reason and propose; they do not grant themselves filesystem scope, network access, credentials, providers, production authority or completion status. Every privileged transition is mediated by deterministic code and a typed record. Design principles: deterministic authority, credentials as capabilities, private coding separated from internet research, strictest policy wins, evidence establishes completion, and recovery is part of correctness.

ARCHITECTURE
The broker core provides typed schemas, SQLite-backed transactional state, content-addressed artifacts, atomic writes, safe path handling, task transitions, leases, approvals, audit events and dossier checkpoints, with the hub CLI as its public entry point. Around it sit a registry, worker boundaries and an evidence plane. Supported topologies are single repository, monorepo, polyrepo microservices, hybrid systems, and client separation — with explicit registration and opt-in rather than ambient discovery.

INTENDED OPERATING PATH (STILL UNDER SYNTHETIC VERIFICATION)
A developer submits one outcome-oriented request such as "add appointment cancellation and fully verify it". The broker resolves the registered system, applies the strictest effective policy, prepares isolated workspaces, records an explicit task-specific worker selection, validates changes, runs quality gates, repairs within configured limits, records evidence, and ends in an explicit verified, paused, blocked, cancelled or infrastructure-failure state.

WHAT IT IS FOR
Start work from a familiar developer surface without bypassing central policy. Avoid re-explaining a large system to every new model session. Keep unrelated clients, repositories, caches, artifacts and task state separated. Use local models for private high-volume implementation, and provider-backed workers only when the project profile and human approvals permit. Isolate public internet research from private repository access. Use credentials through controlled capabilities without placing their values in model context. Produce reproducible evidence for tests, reviews, releases, deployment decisions and recovery. Fail visibly when information, authority, quality, isolation or infrastructure is insufficient.

FAILURE MODES ARE PART OF THE DESIGN
Explicit handling for worker unavailable, malformed or incomplete worker output, resource conflict, missing authorization, scanner or isolation unavailable, quality gate failure, deployment health failure and process interruption.

        "Problem: A healthcare assistant that correctly escalated chest pain last month can quietly become vague, dismissive or unsafe after a prompt, model, retrieval-corpus or provider version change — and ordinary application tests rarely express conversational safety expectations at all. Solution: A local-first tool that runs chatbots, RAG applications and AI agents through synthetic patient scenarios, evaluates the responses with deterministic checks plus optional semantic judges, and produces reviewable JSON and self-contained HTML evidence showing what was tested, what passed, what failed and why each verdict was assigned. No-PHI by architecture — fictional synthetic patients only, no hosted accounts, no telemetry, no silent third-party transmission. Current evidence: 149 tests passing, Ruff clean, strict mypy clean.",

      fullDescription: `A local-first safety and evidence-testing product for healthcare and wellness AI assistants. It runs chatbots, retrieval applications and AI agents through synthetic patient scenarios, evaluates the observed responses, and produces reviewable JSON and self-contained HTML evidence showing what was tested, what passed, what failed, and why each verdict was assigned.

WHY IT EXISTS
Healthcare-oriented assistants change behavior when prompts, models, code, retrieval corpora, safety policies or provider versions change. A response that previously escalated chest pain or crisis language may later become vague, dismissive, overly reassuring or unsafe. Ordinary application tests rarely express those conversational safety expectations clearly. VitalProbe converts them into repeatable synthetic scenarios and explicit evidence — so a builder can test an assistant before a demonstration, compare a release against a baseline, inspect individual checks, and hand a self-contained dossier to a reviewer.

NO-PHI BY ARCHITECTURE
Fictional synthetic patients only. No production conversations, no real patient records, no hosted accounts, no server-side customer-response storage, no telemetry, no analytics, no silent third-party transmission. This boundary is enforced in project rules and tests because it is part of the product design rather than a policy note.

ARCHITECTURE — DEPENDENCIES FLOW TOWARD THE CORE
Contracts (typed test cases, responses, checks, verdicts, run artifacts) · Packs (suite discovery, YAML loading, schema validation, draft/review status) · Targets (shared adapter protocol with REST and MCP implementations) · Evaluators (deterministic response and trajectory checks) · Judges (semantic judge protocol with local and opt-in provider backends) · Runner (concurrency, retries, target calls, checks, aggregation, timing) · Reporting (canonical JSON and self-contained HTML dossier) · Experience (local runs, baselines, regressions, labels, learning inputs) · Entitlements (offline signed-license verification and feature gates) · Simulator (multi-turn fictional patient generation and trajectory evaluation) · Dashboard (local clinical-ledger views and trigger-run workflow) · MCP (target adapter and licensed product-side agent tools). New product behavior belongs in the engine rather than being duplicated in a UI or command shell.

WHAT IT DELIVERS
Reproduce important safety scenarios without real patient data. Distinguish product findings from network and configuration errors. Combine deterministic checks with optional semantic scoring. Preserve exact synthetic inputs, observed outputs, evidence, latency and limitations. Detect PASS-to-WARN or PASS-to-FAIL regressions between runs. Track run history locally without accounts or hosted storage. Generate adversarial draft variants from failures while keeping a human review gate. Test both single-turn and multi-turn behavior. Integrate through CLI, dashboard, REST, MCP, Docker and agent-oriented tooling.

VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
55 Python source modules, approximately 4,836 source lines, 74 classes and 187 functions. 21 top-level test modules and approximately 3,169 test lines. 149 automated tests passing at the current checkpoint, Ruff clean, strict mypy clean. The automated suite verifies the implemented source and synthetic scenarios — it does not replace human clinical review, human calibration labels, attorney review, or a customer-specific acceptance process.

DELIBERATE LIMITS
VitalProbe does not certify a target, grant regulatory approval, replace clinical judgment, or provide legal advice. Reports describe observed results and limitations. Clinical and legal interpretation stays with qualified humans, and the product tiers keep explicit human-only gates. Law mapping is informational. Pre-release: package version 0.1.0.dev0, Python 3.12+, Apache-2.0 for the public code repository. Default operating cost is zero — local and synthetic workflows run without paid provider calls.`,
